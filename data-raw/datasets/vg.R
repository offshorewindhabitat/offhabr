# Community guidance for developing this website was to provide a single
# productivity product as a Standard product. For this, we initially chose the
# original Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) (Behrenfeld and
# Falkowski, 1997a) as the standard algorithm. The VGPM is a "chlorophyll-based"
# model that estimate net primary production from chlorophyll using a
# temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic
# efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll,
# available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. Shown below is an example
# of VGPM-based global ocean net primary production for July of 2016.
#
# Standard products are based on chlorophyll, temperature and PAR data from
# SeaWiFS, MODIS and VIIRS satellites, along with estimates of euphotic zone
# depth from a model developed by Morel and Berthon (1989) and based on
# chlorophyll concentration. Monthly global ocean production for July 2016 was
# 4.43626 Pg (1 Pg = 10**15 g.)
